# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


## Description 
This app creates a calendar style planner that uses third-party API and JavaScript. The time slots on this app are inline with a normal work day. (9am-5pm). You can save events/tasks for the day using local storage. The planner also uses color coordination to tell you what hour block you are currently in using Moment.js. 

## Installation 
This app currently does not need installation.

## Usage
In order to use this app, you must first select a time slot you'd like to record an evenet/task. Once you have that slot filled, you must then hit the save button for that slot in order to save the task to local storage.
